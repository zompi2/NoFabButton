# NoFabButton
Just removes the Fab Button from Unreal Engine 5 Content Browser.

## Before
![fab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bd474eb-6d1e-416c-a1d2-307819a3181c)

## After
![nofab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98d940f8-42d4-4e51-9c70-72ae412e6163)

## Why?
Because my muscle memory made me pressing wrong button.

## Just disable Fab?
I still want to use it, I just want this button in Content Browser.

## How to open it then?
`Windw -> Fab`
